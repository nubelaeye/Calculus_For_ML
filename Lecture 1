# Today we are going to start the supreme topic CALCULUS which will be awesome topic
# The Calculus is the Second part of Mathematics of the Machine Learning it is based on:-
# 1. Limits 
# 2. Calculating Derivatives with differentiation...
# 3. Automatic Differniationg

# So let's start with basics whta is calculus:-

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the * Study of continuous change *. 
It is a powerful mathematical tool that "provides a framework for understanding how 
quantities change in relation to one another". Calculus consists of two main branches: 
    1. differential calculus.
    2. integral calculus.

Differential calculus primarily focuses on the concept of the derivative. 
The derivative of a function at a certain point represents the rate of change of the function
at that point. * It helps in understanding the instantaneous rate of change of a function, 
as well as its slope at any given point.

Integral calculus, on the other hand, focuses on the concept of the integral. 
Integration is essentially the reverse process of differentiation, and it helps in finding
the accumulation of quantities and the areas under curves. It is widely used in determining
the total change or total quantity over a continuous interval.

Calculus has various practical applications in diverse fields such as physics, engineering,
economics, computer science, and many more. It plays a fundamental role in modeling and 
analyzing real-world phenomena, making it an essential tool for solving complex problems in
these domains.
