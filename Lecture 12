# In this lecture we will study about the * Partial derivatives...
# It enables us to calculate the derivatives of multivariate equations.
# Let's consider an example -> z = x^2 - y^2.
# We can obtain derivative of z with respect to x by considering y as a constant so y removed.
# Now let's solve the equation after y is removed.. -> dz/dx = 2x - 0 -> z = 2x.
# The d represented here is not d it's a curved d) known as del.
# Now what does this equation means : z = 2x -> the slope of z along x axis is twice the value
# of the x axis value.
# Ok now it's talk -> It's CODE time...

# Here is lot of stuff be carefull and read with concentration...
# As you know that we are going to use partial derivative for the multivariate functions..
# So the equation formed is same: z = x^2 - y ^ 2
# So, let's create a function for this equation..
def eq(x,y):
    return (x**2 - y**2)

x = np.linspace(-3,3,1000)
z = eq(x, 0)

# So, let's plot it out....
