# In this lecture we will study about the Binary Classification for this I'm Super exicited..
"""
Binary classification is a fundamental concept in machine learning and statistics used to
categorize data into two distinct groups or classes. The term "binary" refers to the fact 
that there are only two possible outcomes or classes. The main objective of binary 
classification is to develop a model that can predict to which of the two classes a new piece
of data belongs based on the features or attributes associated with it.

In binary classification, the two classes are typically represented as positive (+) and
negative (-) classes, or as class 1 and class 0. The process involves training a model using
a labeled dataset, where each data point is associated with a class label. The model then 
learns patterns and relationships in the data to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Commonly used algorithms for binary classification include logistic regression, decision trees,
support vector machines (SVM), naive Bayes classifiers, and various types of neural networks.
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) are often used to assess the performance 
of a binary classification model.

Binary classification is widely applied in various real-world applications, including spam
detection in emails, medical diagnosis, fraud detection in financial transactions, 
sentiment analysis, and many other areas where data can be categorized into two distinct groups.

# If y = 1, and the prediction is 0.49 is 100% Wrong and if the prediction is 0.51% is 100%
# Correct it's correct as much as the prediction of 0.99
