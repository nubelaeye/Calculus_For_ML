# In this lecture we will study about the confusion matrix...
# The confusion matrix are those condition in which the machine model is unable to 
# distinguish or differentiate the example so it's named as the confusion matrix.

"""
" A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a 
classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known. "
It allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. It is a useful tool for 
evaluating the performance of a machine learning model, especially in the case of 
binary classification, where the output can be either positive or negative.

In a binary classification task, the confusion matrix has four important terms:

1.True Positives (TP): The cases in which the model predicted the positive class correctly.
2.True Negatives (TN): The cases in which the model predicted the negative class correctly.
* 3.False Positives (FP): The cases in which the model predicted the positive class, 
but the actual class was negative. Also known as Type I error.
* 4.False Negatives (FN): The cases in which the model predicted the negative class, 
but the actual class was positive. Also known as Type II error.
