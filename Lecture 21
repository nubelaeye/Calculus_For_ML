# In this lecture we will study about the Numeric Integration with python..

from scipy.integrate import quad # the term quad means the quadrature = numerical integration

def g(x):
    return 2*x

print(quad(g,3,4)) # 1st ouput is for the answer and the 2nd is for the error detection.
# And now moving on let's calculate the real Area under the ROC(Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve..
