# In this lecture we will calculate "The calculus of Infintesimals".
# To calculate it we will use the defferential calculus.
# An integral accuracy improves as we approach an infinite-sided polygon, so too does 
# with the differentially accuracy improves as we approach a curve...
# Ok then let's see how does it looks like the code:-

import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(-10,10, 1000) #the graph will plot from -10 to 10 with 1000 points...
y = (x**2 + 2*x + 2)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
_ = ax.plot(x, y)

plt.show()

# Before, you go deep in a curve you will find that it doesn't looks like that it would have
# Any straight line or made up of straight lines... But, after we go deep in the curve shape
# we will find that the shape has a straight line... -> You know that's true.
# ok, then let's have a look..

f, fx = plt.subplots()
fx.set_xlim([-2, 0])
fx.set_ylim([0, 2])
_ = fx.plot(x,y)
plt.show()

fi, vx = plt.subplots()
vx.set_xlim([-1.5,-0.5])
vx.set_ylim([0.5, 1.5])
_ = vx.plot(x,y)
plt.show()

fl, gx = plt.subplots()
gx.set_xlim([-1.01,-0.99])
gx.set_ylim([0.99, 1.01])
_ = gx.plot(x,y)
plt.show()
