# In this lecture we will study about the Real world Applications of the Calculus..
# The Differentials optimize the curves by finding it's Minima & Maxima these are plural form.
# Used in : engineering(maximize the strength) and (minimize the cost).
# And you know that it's widely used in machine learing and in the deep learning.
#    Example -> Gradient descent to minimize the cost.
#    And same as the Gradient ascent to maximize the score.
# In reciever operating characteristics, examle -> Dog or Cat. (Binary Classification)
# In Probability "Expectation" of random variable which is widely used in machine learning
# and the deep learing too.
