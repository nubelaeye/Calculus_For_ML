# In this lecture we will study the last rule of derivation in differentiation.. -> "The Power Rule on chain function"
# Ok, let's see the equation formed here as we know it's the combination of power rule and the chain rule 
# The equation is : d/dx * u^n = nu^(n-1) * du/dx.

# So, for better understanding let's take an example...
# Let's the function y = (3x + 1)^2 and n = 2.
# u = 3x+1 -> 3x -> 3.
# The result goes like this: (2(3+1))(3) -> (6x+2) * (3) -> 18x + 6.
